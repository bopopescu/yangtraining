This directory contains YANG models for Cisco platforms. There are several sub-directories:

* **common** - models that have some level of support across all IOS-XR, NX-OS and IOS-XE; there may be deviations either published by devices or available in OS-specific directories
* **xr** - models that are specific to IOS-XR platforms
* **nx** - models that are specific to NX-OS platforms
* **xe** - models that are specific to IOS-XE platforms

Each subdirectory may have further OS/platform-specific information in a README file.
