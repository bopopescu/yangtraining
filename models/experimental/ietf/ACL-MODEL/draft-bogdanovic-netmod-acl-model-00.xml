  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>Access Control List (ACL) are one of the basic elements to configure
   device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking concepts
   such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.</t>
   <t>An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
   networking device.  Each rule is represented by an Access Control
   Entry (ACE).</t>
   <t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria.</t>
   <t>The match criteria consist of tuple of match criteria and metadata matching.</t>
   <t><list style="symbols">
     <t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such as
      address or class of service or port numbers.</t>
     <t>Metadata matching applies to fields associated with the packet but
     not in the packet header such as input interface or overall packet length</t>
   </list></t>
   <t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching criteria is
   met. These can be any sort of thing from counting to policing or simply 
   forwarding.The list of potential actions is endless depending on the 
   innovations of the networked devices.</t>

  <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
    <t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> data model for the configuration of ACLs. It is very important that model can be easily reused between vendors and between applications.</t>

   <t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the filter constructs and Actions that they support. Therefore this draft proposes a simple model that augmented by vendor proprietary models. </t>
  </section> <!-- problem -->

  <section anchor="design" title="Design of the ACL Model">
    <t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a common understanding of what an access list is. An access list contains an ordered list of rules called access list entries â€“ ACEs. Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of subsequent ACEs. Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria. The match criteria consist of packet header matching and metadata matching. Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such as address or class of service or port numbers.  Metadata matching applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the packet header such as input interface, packet length, or source or destination prefix length. The actions can be any sort of thing from logging to rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding. There is a default ACE which applies if a packet does not match any of the other ACEs. As some devices fail closed (reject), some fail open (accept) with no explicit configuration, this model defines daufault action, ACE which applies if a packet does not match any of the other ACEs. This will help with cross platform conformitiy and for that reason this draft specifies deny as default action. There is overall operational state for the ACL and operational state for each ACE, and depending on the action, operational state for each action. Access-lists can also have notifications such as logging, configuration changing, activation state changes. The ACL can be applied to targets within the device which may be interfaces of a networked device, applications or features running in the device, or other objects. When applied to interfaces of the networked device, the ACL is applied in a direction which indicates if it should be applied to packet entering (input) or leaving the device (output).</t>
  <t>This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models. The base model is very simple and with this design we hope to achieve needed flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.</t>
    

    <section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
      <t>There are three YANG modules in the model. The first module, "ietf-acl", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor. In effect, the module can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass". It imports module "packet-headers" into the match container. The packet headers can be extended with different types and fragments.The packet headers modules can easily be extended to reuse definitions from other modules such as IPFIX <xref target="RFC5101"/> or migrate proprietary augmented module definitions into the standard module.</t>

      <t>"ietf-acl" is the standard top level module for Access lists. It has
    a container for "access-list" to store access list information.
    This container has information identifying the access list by a
    name("acl-name") and a list("access-list-entries") of rules associated
    with the "acl-name".
    Each of the entries in the list("access-list-entries") indexed by the
    string "rule-name" have containers defining "matches" and "actions".
    The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in
    "packet-fields".
    The "actions" define behavior to undertake once a "match" has been

      <section anchor="newcoacl" title="A company proprietary module example">
	<t>In the figure below is an example how proprietary models can be created on top of base ACL module. It is a simple example of how to use 'augment' with an XPath expression which extends instances of a particular type. In this example, all /ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl:access-list-entries/ietf-acl:matches are augmented with a new choice, protocol-payload-choice. The protocol-payload-choice uses a grouping with an enumeration of all supported protocol values. In other example, /ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl:access-list-entries/ietf-acl:actions are augmented with new choice of actions. Here is an inclusive list of cases listed within a choice statement.</t>

<section anchor="nftables" title="Linux nftables">
      <t>As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform, the Linux data model is changing. Previously ACLs in Linux were highly protocol specific and different utilities were used for it (iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables). Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been provided. This utility follows very similarly the same base model as proposed in this draft. The nftables support input and output ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match and action.</t>

  <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] <xref target="RFC6241"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH [RFC6242] <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] <xref target="RFC6536"/> provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

   <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,  &lt;edit-config&gt;) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.</t>

   <t>TBD: List specific Subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability.
