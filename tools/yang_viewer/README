This tool started as a quick side project to build a GUI based visualization tool for
 avigating the sometime complex yang models.
 
It leverages the OpenDaylight (www.opendaylight.org) yang parser 
(which has some restrictions) to compile the yang models into a java representation
which can then be rendered into the java GUI.

Current Status:
* This application is some-what out of date from the current OpenDaylight yang
compiler version. The hope is by publishing the source code others can contribute
and help to keep it up to date.

Build Notes:
a) This application requires maven to compile (the version of maven is restricted by OpenDaylight)
  * I would suggest trying the latest maven first and if you experience issues refer to the OpenDaylight project for the specific version of yangtools imported.
b) In the target directory a "jar-with-dependencies.jar" will be created which is a runnable, uber jar.
c) NOTE: The <repositories> tag in the pom.xml provides access to OpenDaylight snapshots (which we currently use). Be weary of any local entries in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file which may override these!

Build Steps:
1) cd to the folder with the pom.xml (yang/tools/yang-viewer)
2) run 'mvn clean install'  
3) Run the compiled uber jar from a system with GUI access:
    java -jar target/yang-viewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    
TODO:
1) Move to using the latest OpenDaylight (preferably released versions instead of snapshots now
that there are officially released yangparser versions)

Thats it! Enjoy.
